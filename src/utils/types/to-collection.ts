 * ToCollections Type
 *
 * This type transforms properties of a given type T. It traverses the properties
 * of T and transforms arrays into MikroORM Collection instances, while
 * recursively transforming nested objects as well.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This type is typically used to transform properties of entities when using
 * MikroORM to work with databases. It helps convert arrays into Collection
 * instances that can be used for querying and manipulating data.
