/**
 * PaginationObject Class
 *
 * Provides a consistent structure for paginated results in GraphQL. This abstract class
 * should be extended by other ObjectTypes that need to provide paginated data, ensuring
 * a consistent response structure across different queries and mutations.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - hasNextPage: Indicates if subsequent pages exist after the current page.
 * - hasPreviousPage: Indicates if there are pages before the current one.
 * - totalItems: The total number of items across all pages.
 * - totalPages: The total number of available pages.
 *
 * Usage:
 * When creating an ObjectType that returns paginated data, extend this class to inherit the
 * pagination-related fields. It ensures that paginated responses have a standardized format.
 *
 * Example:
 * Imagine you have a `User` entity and you want to paginate the results. You would create a
 * `PaginatedUserResponse` that extends this `PaginationObject` and adds an additional field,
 * say `users`, which would be an array of `User` objects.
