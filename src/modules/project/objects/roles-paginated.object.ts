/**
 * The `ProjectPaginatedProjectRoles` class provides a structure for paginated
 * results of project roles within a project management system. In many applications,
 * especially those dealing with potentially large datasets, pagination is essential
 * for performance reasons and improved user experience. By splitting results into
 * pages, the system can efficiently manage and display data.
 *
 * This class extends the `PaginationObject`, which likely encapsulates common
 * pagination metadata such as the current page, total number of items, and items
 * per page. The extension ensures that `ProjectPaginatedProjectRoles` inherits
 * these essential pagination properties.

   * consistent structure and includes all necessary metadata about the role.

   * might transform or wrap each `ProjectRolesObject` into another structure
