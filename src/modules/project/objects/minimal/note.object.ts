/**
 * Represents a tuple containing the minimal set of properties required
 * for a project's notes. This not only includes the direct properties of the note
 * but also the fields related to the user who created the note.
 *
 * The tuple is structured to capture:
 * - The unique identifier for the note (`id`).
 * - The title of the note (`title`).
 * - The content or body of the note (`content`).
 * - The associated properties of the user (`created_by`) who authored the note.
 *   This is achieved using the `createFieldPaths` function, which combines the
 *   base entity ('created_by' in this case) with its minimal properties
 *   (from `AuthUserMinimalProperties`).
 *
 * By defining this tuple, it provides a standardized approach to select the essential
 * fields for a project's notes across the application. This ensures consistency,
 * optimizes queries by selecting only necessary fields, and aids in reducing chances
 * of errors.
 *
 * @constant ProjectNotesMinimalProperties
 *
 * @example
 * Assuming the tuple is used to generate a SQL SELECT statement:
 * The fields would be:
 * - 'id'
 * - 'title'
 * - 'content'
 * - 'created_by.id'
 * - 'created_by.first_name'
 * - 'created_by.last_name'
 * - 'created_by.username'
