 * The `ProjectRolesObject` class serves as a blueprint for defining roles within a project management system.

 * where different roles can perform different tasks based on their set permissions.
 *
 * This particular implementation utilizes a bit-based permission system, which provides an efficient way
 * to store and manage permissions. Using bits, each role can have a combination of permissions represented
 * as a single integer, making it easy to perform operations like checking, granting, or revoking permissions.
