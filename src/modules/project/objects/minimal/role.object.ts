/**
 * Represents a tuple containing the minimal set of properties required
 * for roles associated with a project. This tuple focuses on capturing
 * the most essential details that define a role within a project's context.
 *
 * The tuple is structured to capture:
 * - The unique identifier for the role (`id`).
 * - The name representing the role (`name`).
 * - The permissions associated with the role, typically represented
 *   as bit-based values (`permissions`).
 *
 * By defining this tuple, it provides a standardized approach to select the essential
 * fields for a project's roles across the application. This ensures consistency,
 * optimizes queries by selecting only necessary fields, and aids in reducing chances
 * of errors.
 *
 * @constant ProjectRolesMinimalProperties
 *
 * @example
 * Assuming the tuple is used to generate a SQL SELECT statement:
 * The fields would be:
 * - 'id'
 * - 'name'
 * - 'permissions'

 * The `ProjectRolesObject` class serves as a blueprint for defining roles within a project management system.

 * where different roles can perform different tasks based on their set permissions.
 *
 * This particular implementation utilizes a bit-based permission system, which provides an efficient way
 * to store and manage permissions. Using bits, each role can have a combination of permissions represented
 * as a single integer, making it easy to perform operations like checking, granting, or revoking permissions.
