/**
 * Represents a tuple containing the minimal set of properties required
 * for a project entity. This not only includes the direct properties of the project
 * but also the fields related to the user who owns the project.
 *
 * The tuple is structured to capture:
 * - The unique identifier for the project (`id`).
 * - A brief description of the project (`description`).
 * - The end date or expected completion date for the project (`end_date`).
 * - The name or title of the project (`name`).
 * - The start or commencement date of the project (`start_date`).
 * - The associated properties of the user (`owner`) who owns the project.
 *   This is achieved using the `createFieldPaths` function, which combines the
 *   base entity ('owner' in this case) with its minimal properties
 *   (from `AuthUserMinimalProperties`).
 *
 * By defining this tuple, it provides a standardized approach to select the essential
 * fields for a project across the application. This ensures consistency,
 * optimizes queries by selecting only necessary fields, and aids in reducing chances
 * of errors.
 *

 * @example
 * Assuming the tuple is used to generate a SQL SELECT statement:
 * The fields would be:
 * - 'id'
 * - 'description'
 * - 'end_date'
 * - 'name'
 * - 'start_date'
 * - 'owner.id'
 * - 'owner.first_name'
 * - 'owner.last_name'
 * - 'owner.username'
