 * associated with them. This input type aids in the creation of such roles with
 * their associated permissions.

 * The input ensures that the role name adheres to specific length constraints,
 * the permissions are represented in a bit format, and the project ID is a valid
 * UUID. This ensures the integrity and correctness of the data when creating new roles.
