 * The `ProjectModule` class is a NestJS module responsible for grouping together

 * and the GraphQL resolver which exposes the API endpoints for client interactions.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Import necessary database entities and modules to ensure Dependency Injection is correctly resolved.
 * - Register services and resolvers to manage project-related functionalities.
