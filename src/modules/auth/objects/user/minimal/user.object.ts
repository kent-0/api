/**
 * Represents a tuple containing the minimal set of properties
 * required to identify and display basic information for an authenticated user.
 *
 * This tuple is designed to be used in conjunction with the `createFieldPaths`
 * function to generate fully qualified paths for accessing specific fields
 * within nested objects or database structures.
 *
 * By having this tuple, it standardizes the essential fields for an authenticated user
 * across the application, ensuring consistency and reducing chances of errors.
 * This can be especially useful when selecting nested properties from databases
 * or filtering nested properties in API responses.
 *
 * @constant AuthUserMinimalProperties
 *
 * @example
 * If you want to generate field paths for an entity named 'user':
 *
 * const fieldPaths = createFieldPaths('user', ...AuthUserMinimalProperties);
 * // Returns: ['user.id', 'user.first_name', 'user.last_name', 'user.username']
