/**
 * The `BoardStepCreateInput` class defines the necessary information required to create a new
 * step within a specific project board. Steps in project boards are often used to represent
 * phases or stages of tasks, such as 'To Do', 'In Progress', or 'Done'. Each step can have
 * specific constraints, like a maximum number of tasks.
 *
 * The primary attributes of this class include:
 * 1. `boardId`: Identifies the board where the new step will be created.
 * 2. `description`: Provides a brief explanation about the purpose or significance of the step.
 * 3. `finishStep`: Determines if the step represents the final stage in the task's lifecycle.
 * 4. `max`: Specifies the maximum number of tasks that can reside within the step.
 * 5. `name`: A descriptive name for the step.
 * 6. `position`: The display position of the step within the task row.
 *
 * With these attributes, users can create steps that cater to their specific workflow needs,
 * ensuring that tasks move efficiently from one step to another while adhering to any
 * constraints set by the board administrators.
