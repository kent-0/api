/**
 * The `BoardObject` provides a comprehensive view of a project board, encapsulating
 * both its inherent attributes and its relationship to the overarching project. This
 * class is suitable for scenarios where a more detailed understanding of the board's
 * context within a project is essential.
 *
 * The class offers four primary attributes:
 * 1. `created_by`: Represents the user who created the board. This attribute ensures
 *    traceability and accountability.
 * 2. `description`: A textual overview of the board's intent, providing users with
 *    clarity on its purpose.
 * 3. `name`: The primary identifier for the board.
 * 4. `project`: Represents the project to which the board belongs. This relationship
 *    establishes the board's context within the larger project structure.
 *
 * By encompassing these attributes, `BoardObject` offers a holistic view of the board,
 * making it suitable for detailed board examinations or management tasks.
 *
 * @see ProjectMinimalObject - For details about the minimal representation of a project.
