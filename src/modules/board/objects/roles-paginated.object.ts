/**
 * Represents a paginated view of roles associated with a specific board.

 * such as offset and limit. Pagination is an essential feature for UIs that
 * might need to display a large number of roles, making it feasible to break
 * down the list into smaller chunks.
 *
 * The class extends `PaginationObject` which presumably provides generic
 * pagination details such as total counts, current page number, etc. The
 * `items` property specifically holds the paginated list of board roles.
