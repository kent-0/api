/**
 * Represents a tuple containing the minimal set of properties required
 * for a board's members. This tuple is designed to not only capture the
 * direct properties of a board member but also the attributes related
 * to their roles and user details.
 *
 * The tuple is structured to capture:
 * - The unique identifier for the board member (`id`).
 * - The associated properties of the roles (`roles`) assigned to the board member.
 *   This is achieved using the `createFieldPaths` function, which combines the
 *   base entity ('roles' in this case) with its minimal properties
 *   (from `BoardRolesMinimalProperties`).
 * - The associated properties of the user (`user`) who is the member of the board.
 *   Again, this is achieved using the `createFieldPaths` function combined with
 *   `AuthUserMinimalProperties`.
 *
 * By defining this tuple, it provides a standardized approach to select the essential
 * fields for a board's members across the application. This ensures consistency,
 * optimizes queries by selecting only necessary fields, and aids in reducing chances
 * of errors.
 *
 * @constant BoardMembersMinimalProperties
 *
 * @example
 * Assuming the tuple is used to generate a SQL SELECT statement:
 * The fields would be:
 * - 'id'
 * - 'roles.id'
 * - 'roles.name'
 * - 'roles.permissions'
 * - 'user.id'
 * - 'user.first_name'
 * - 'user.last_name'
 * - 'user.username'
