/**
 * Represents a tuple containing the minimal set of properties required
 * for a board's roles. This tuple is designed to capture the fundamental
 * attributes that characterize a role within the context of a board.
 *
 * The tuple is structured to capture:
 * - The unique identifier for the role (`id`).
 * - The name or title of the role (`name`).
 * - The specific permissions associated with the role (`permissions`).
 *
 * By defining this tuple, it provides a standardized approach to select the essential
 * fields for a board's roles across the application. This ensures consistency,
 * optimizes queries by selecting only necessary fields, and aids in reducing chances
 * of errors.
 *
 * @constant BoardRolesMinimalProperties
 *
 * @example
 * Assuming the tuple is used to generate a SQL SELECT statement:
 * The fields would be:
 * - 'id'
 * - 'name'
 * - 'permissions'

 * a summary view, this minimalistic representation ensures that only the most
 * relevant data about the role is presented.
