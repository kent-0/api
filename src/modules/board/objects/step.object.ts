/**
 * The `BoardStepObject` class represents a distinct step or stage within a project board.
 * Steps are critical components of project boards as they help organize tasks based on
 * their current status or phase. Each step can have attributes that dictate its behavior,
 * such as whether it's the final step in the board's flow or if there's a limit to the
 * number of tasks it can contain.
 *
 * The main attributes of this class include:
 * 1. `board`: References the board to which the step belongs. This association ensures that
 *    the step is contextually relevant to the tasks and workflow of the board.
 * 2. `description`: A brief explanation offering insights about the step's role or significance
 *    within the board.
 * 3. `finish_step`: A flag indicating if this step represents the end of the board's flow.
 *    Tasks reaching this step are considered to be in their final stage.
 * 4. `max`: Specifies a limit on the number of tasks that can reside within the step at any
 *    given time.
 * 5. `name`: A descriptive label for the step.
 * 6. `position`: The display order of the step relative to other steps on the board.
 *
 * By defining steps using this class, users can create a structured flow for their tasks,
 * moving them from one stage to another based on progress, reviews, or other criteria.
