Welcome to the Core API of Kento, a robust and scalable backend solution inspired by popular task management platforms like Trello and Jira. Our aim is to provide a seamless experience for managing projects and their associated task boards. Whether you're a small team looking to keep track of your tasks or a large organization aiming to streamline your project management processes, this API has got you covered.

Built with cutting-edge technologies like NestJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL, this project ensures high performance, security, and ease of use. With Mikro-ORM for object-relational mapping, we ensure smooth interactions with the database, and with the upcoming addition of Redis, users can expect even faster response times due to efficient caching.

The modular architecture allows for easy scalability and maintenance. Each module, such as Auth, Board, and Project, has been meticulously crafted to handle its specific functionalities, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

Dive into the details below to understand more about the individual modules, entities, and the requirements to get this project up and running.
